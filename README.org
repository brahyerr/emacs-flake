* Simple Emacs flake

a simple emacs flake using [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]]

** Adding external packages

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  emacs-wrapped = with pkgs; symlinkJoin {
    name = "emacs";
    buildInputs = [ makeWrapper ];
    paths = [ emacs-unwrapped ];
    postBuild = let 
    path = [
      ## Add your external packages here ##
      fzf
      ripgrep
      ...
    ];
    ...
#+END_SRC

** Adding/editing config files

- Config files should be placed in =./config/=.
- Nix will read the directory in lexicographical order.
  - So, to edit load order of config files, edit the names of the files if necessary.

- Packages are added using use-package.
  - Ex.
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (use magit
	   :ensure t)
    #+END_SRC
- Packages are not added directly through use-package, and the config is parsed with Nix first.
  - Nix does not support unicode characters, so make sure not to have any in your config files.

** Notes
- Despite having an lsp-mode Java configuration, the language server for Java needs to be installed *outside* of this config. I've tried to create a config I'm satisfied with using eglot, but it hasn't worked out (yet).
